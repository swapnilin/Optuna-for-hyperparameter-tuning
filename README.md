Using Optuna for Hyperparameter tuning

Optuna is a popular hyperparameter optimization library, and it offers several advantages over traditional methods like grid search.

| **Aspect**                           | **Grid Search**                                                                                           | **Optuna**                                                                                                                |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Efficiency**                       | Evaluates every combination of hyperparameters. Can be computationally expensive for large search spaces. | Uses efficient algorithms like TPE. It's more sample-efficient and can find good hyperparameters with fewer trials than grid search.                                                               |
| **Dynamic Search Space**             | Requires a fixed search space. You need to define all possible values for each hyperparameter upfront.                                                                            | Allows for dynamic search spaces.                                                                                          |
| **Pruning**                          | No inherent mechanism for early stopping. If a particular combination of hyperparameters is unlikely to produce a good result, it will still complete the full evaluation.                                                                 | Supports pruning strategies for early stopping. If during a trial, it becomes clear that the given hyperparameters are not promising, the trial can be stopped early, saving computational resources.                                                                            |
| **Integration and Flexibility**      | Integrates well with scikit-learn but may require work with other frameworks.                             | Offers easy integration with various machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, LightGBM, and more.                                              |
| **Parallelization**                  | Can be parallelized but each worker operates independently.                                               | Supports distributed optimization with coordinated workers.                                                               |
| **Visualization**                    | Typically lacks built-in visualization tools.                                                              | Provides a suite of visualization tools to understand the optimization process, relationships between hyperparameters, and more.                                                                                   |
| **Flexibility in Objective Functions** | Works with models that return a score.                                                                   | Can optimize any objective function, not just model scores. For example, you can optimize for model inference speed, memory usage, or any custom metric.                                                               |
